Remote APIs - REST - Representational State Transfer used for creating web services. 
  REST API - is easy way of accessing web services simple and flexible way without any processig.

How web works:
  let's assume your computer's IE browser as a clinet and going to connect server using URL
  URL - Universal Resource Locator URI - Universal Resource Identifier.
  here We mentioned shema portion as 'http'
  in query string after '?' mark we can able to send our request to server by GET method
  
  browser - http request (generaly its a GET - only used to send request and receive a response data)
  HTTP - Hyper Test Tansfer Protocol - originaaly it was designed as a Stateless protocol
  
  POST: senda data to server to modify data in the server and gets response from server
  classic example is "Forms"
